The exact element’s position on the offset path is determined by the offset-distance property. An offset path is either a specified path with one or multiple sub-paths or the geometry of a not-styled basic shape. Each shape or path must define an initial position for the computed value of \\\"0\\\" for offset-distance and an initial direction which specifies the rotation of the object to the initial position.\\n\\nIn this specification, a direction (or rotation) of 0 degrees is equivalent to the direction of the positive x-axis in the object’s local coordinate system. In other words, a rotation of 0 degree points to the right side of the UA if the object and its ancestors have no transformation applied.\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"offset-rotate\",\n    \"status\": \"experimental\",\n    \"syntax\": \"[ auto | reverse ] || <angle>\",\n    \"browsers\": [\"FF69\", \"C56\", \"O43\"],\n    \"references\": [{\n      \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n      \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/offset-rotate\"\n    }],\n    \"description\": \"The offset-rotate CSS property defines the direction of the element while positioning along the offset path.\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"max-inline-size\",\n    \"browsers\": [\"FF41\", \"S10.1\", \"C57\", \"O44\"],\n    \"values\": [{\n      \"name\": \"none\",\n      \"description\": \"No limit on the height of the box.\"\n    }],\n    \"status\": \"experimental\",\n    \"syntax\": \"<'max-width'>\",\n    \"references\": [{\n      \"name\": \"MDN Reference\",\n      \"url\": \"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/max-inline-size\"\n    }],\n    \"description\": \"Logical 'max-height'.
